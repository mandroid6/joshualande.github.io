My interest in machine learning and neural networks led me to take up multiple online courses. I believe that online learning has given me opportunities and skills over and above what was possible for me to acquire as a EE undergrad.  

Below is alist of most of the courses I have taken and completed:

1.  **Creative Application of Deep Learning - I on Kadenze**
2.	**Improving Deep Neural Networks by DeepLearning.ai on Coursera**
3.	**Structuring Machine Learning Projects by DeepLearning.ai on Coursera**
4.	**Neural Networks and Deep Learning by DeepLearning.ai on Coursera** 
5.	**Machine Learning by Stanford University(Prof. Andrew Ng) on Coursera**  			      
6.	**Programming for Everybody (Python) by University of Michigan on Coursera**	 
7.	**Digital Image and Video Processing by Northwestern University on Coursera**
8.	**Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science on Udemy**
9.  **Convolutional Neural Networks by DeepLearning.ai on Coursera**
10. **Practical Data Structures and Algorithms in Java**
11. **CS229 - Machine Learning on Stanford Online**
12. **Neural Networks by University of Toronto (Prof. Geoffrey Hinton) on Coursera**


Will be adding brief course descriptions soon.

>> Stay tuned!

Hi guys,

Though it might appear as if this website/blog was created for the sole purpose of posting about the development work done during the Google summer of code 2017, its not limited to it.

I will be posting a variety of content in different programming languages - python, MATLAB, Scilab and possibly R also -  but all will revolve around the central topic of machine learning and deep learning.

For the reason that, I have not followed any academic path to learning about ml and deep learning, my posts will follow a variety of paths.

1. GSoC Development work for machine learning toolbox in Scilab
2. Machine learning based on various Python libraries
3. Matlab explainations of machine learning algorithms 

Subsequently there is going to be a whole lot of content to be posted on this website, for all machine learning needs as and when I learn about them.

I even plan to review popular published papers in this field, to clear my own understanding of the concepts while helping you simultaneously.

Hence don't be surprised if you find two consecutives posts without any seeming connection. I will be adding tags for these posts soon, also an index page is upcoming. 

>If you feel certain topics need more explaination or detailed tutorials, please ping me.

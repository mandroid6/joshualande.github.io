Hi guys,

I will be working with Scilab Enterprises during Google Summer of Code 2017. This is a voluteer work, which mean I am a fixed time contract developer working with developers from Scilab and ESI group to develop newer functionality or improving existing ones.  

The entire program is hosted by Google, and gives opportunity for student developers like myself to get exposure and experience working in the open source software development domain.

For the next 4 months I will be developing a Machine Learning toolbox for Scilab, based on my project proposal.
Mentors from Scilab - Yann, Philippe, Dhruv will be helping and guiding me to sucessfully accomplish this goal.

I will be publishing the work I do during this 3 months timeline of **Google Summer of Code** and all other development || programming I do till my interest lasts.
Oh yes, I will be working alonside **Scilab Enterprises** to develop the Machine Learning Toolbox for the Scilab package.

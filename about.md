Hey there! 
I am Mandar Deshpande from Nagpur, India. A Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology graduate in Electrical And Electronics Engineering, I don't specifically have a CS background, but have strong implementation and conceptual knowledge of core CS.  

Mostly worked on my projects using Java and MATLAB(+Simulink), and have been working on Machine learning since the 3rd year of my engineering.  

Worked with SCILAB as a part of Google Summer of Code 2017, for developing a ml toolbox.

Currently researching deep learning algorithms, and publishing my work on this blog so that it can reach a wider audience.
Tensorflow and keras for developing cnn and rnns.  

All your suggestion and help will be useful, so don't hold back! :D  


>Only persistence fuels my learning engines and the dream to become an actual ml engineer one day!

## Introduction
Hey there! 
I am Mandar Deshpande from Nagpur, India. A Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology graduate in Electrical And Electronics Engineering, I don't specifically have a CS background, but have strong implementation and conceptual knowledge of core CS.  

## Past work/Research
Mostly worked on my projects using Java and MATLAB(+Simulink), and have been working on Machine learning since the 3rd year of my engineering.  
Worked with SCILAB as a part of Google Summer of Code 2017, for developing a ml toolbox.

## Current Engagement
Currently researching PixelCNN based pixel wise image completion models in collboration with IVPL Lab, Northwestern University, and publishing my work on this blog so that it can reach a wider audience. Tensorflow and keras for developing cnn and rnns.   
  
Also learning a deep understanding of PyTorch by working through tutorials and implementing models from scratch. Got selected as an ** International Fellow** for fast.ai's ```Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coder Part 2 v2```. Hence very pysched and working towards gaining an indepth knowledge of implementation rather than theory! 


All your suggestion and help will be useful, so don't hold back! :D  

## Learning moto
>Only persistence fuels my learning engines and the dream to become an actual ml engineer one day!

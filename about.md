## Introduction
Hey there! 
I am Mandar Deshpande from Nagpur, India. A Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology graduate in Electrical And Electronics Engineering, my research interests lie in machine learning with a focus on deep learning for vision tasks. 

## Past work/Research
Mostly worked on my projects using Java and MATLAB(+Simulink), and have been working on Machine learning since the 3rd year of my engineering.  
Worked with SCILAB as a part of Google Summer of Code 2017, for developing a ml toolbox.  
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6738686042439680">Project page</a>
Developed a deep understanding of PyTorch by implementing models from scratch. Got selected as an **International Fellow** for fast.ai's ```Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coder Part 2 v2```. Hence very pysched and working towards gaining an indepth knowledge of implementation rather than theory! 

## Current Engagement
Currently researching PixelCNN based pixel wise image completion models in collboration with IVPL Lab, Northwestern University, and publishing my work on this blog so that it can reach a wider audience. Tensorflow and keras for developing cnn and rnns.   
  
Google Summer of Code 2018 -   
- [Scilab Mentor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4959724454281216): Mentoring student for the development of machine learnign toolbox in Scilab, to extend my last year's jupyter integration for remote script execution
- [Gensim Mentor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4788943535472640): Co-mentor for the Neural networks for Similarity Learning in Gensim toolkit(under Numfocus)

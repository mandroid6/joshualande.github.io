## Introduction

I am Mandar Deshpande from Nagpur, India. Currently a graduate student at **UCLA Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept** with a focus on **signal processing and machine learning**. I graduated from VNIT Nagpur in 2017 where I studied Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

My research interests are in deep learning for vision/nlp and reinforcement learning.


## Past work/Research

- **Google Summer of Code 2019** -
  - [TensorFlow Mentor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4814181524570112) : Mentored [Ryan Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seungjaeryanlee/) in the development of curiosity module for TF-Agents along with [Oscar Ramirez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-ramirez-905913b9/). Ryan implemented Random Network Distillation (RND),  a state-of-the-art bonus-based exploration reinforcement learning algorithm

- **Machine Learning Engineer at Citi** : Solved NLP and CV use cases usig deep learning and traditional vision techniques for images. Utilized NLP for parsing financial documents and extarcting relevant information.
  
- **Google Summer of Code 2018** -   
  - [Scilab Mentor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4959724454281216): Mentored [Soumitra Agrawal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumitra-agarwal/) (student) in the development of machine learning toolbox for [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org), to extend my GSoC 2017's work on jupyter integration for remote script execution
  - [Gensim Mentor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4788943535472640): Co-mentor to [Aneesh Joshi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aneeshyjoshi/) on the neural networks for similarity learning research for [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), a topic modelling and nlp toolkit (under Numfocus) 
  
  - **Google Summer of Code 2017**: Worked with [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org) to develop a modular ml toolbox, which allowed remote execution of python model traning over network and inference on local machine<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6738686042439680">Project page</a>  

  - Developed a deep understanding of PyTorch by implementing models from scratch. Got selected as an **International Fellow** for fast.ai's ```Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coder Part 2 v2```

  - Researched PixelCNN based pixel wise image completion models in collboration with IVPL Lab, Northwestern University. Utilized Tensorflow and keras to develop residual networks.
